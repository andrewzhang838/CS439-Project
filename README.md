# CS439-Project
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify Amazon Kindle reviews as helpful or not helpful, based on the review content and associated metadata. By analyzing features such as review text, summary, and star ratings, the system helps identify patterns in what makes a review valuable to other consumers. The project utilizes a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms to deliver insights into review quality and consumer behavior.
